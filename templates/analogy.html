                <h2>The Era of Democratized Stock Trading (1980 - 2000)</h2>
                <p>
                    This particular period is a spectacular illustration of what happens when stock trading goes mainstream.
                     Stocks surged for two decades largely because owning stocks became the norm, 
                     and trading became accessible to everyone—not just brokers. 
                     Investing transitioned from a niche activity among elite traders 
                        to a common strategy for everyday households.
                </p>
                <p>
                    This period represents a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of approximately 13.5% over twenty years.
                </p>

            <p>
                You can see how P/E ratios expanded significantly, especially during the 1990s, 
                indicating that valuation multiples were rising—not just earnings. 
                In simple terms, it wasn’t earnings driving the growth, 
                but the increasing number of participants entering the market and buying stocks. 
                The conclusion is simple: if you enter the market before it goes mainstream, you can more easily multiply your money.

                <h2>The Era of Democratized Crypto Trading (2024 - 2032)</h2>
                <p>
                    Here is why everyone thinks that the same thing is happening with crypto
                        (note, below are the facts that you can easily verify yourself):
                    <ul>
                        <li>The President of the United States has decided to stockpile crypto in the National Reserve.</li>
                        <li>The SEC has withdrawn and ended its lawsuits against many major crypto players.</li>
                        <li>BTC, ETH, and SOL are now available as ETFs and can be purchased through regular brokerage accounts.</li>
                        <li>Crypto is available through Fidelity Investments.</li>
                        <li>Crypto is available in 401(k) plans.</li>
                    </ul>
                </p>
                <p>
                    It’s typical for early adopters to be rewarded generously, as long as you recognize the potential in all of it.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I'm not making any predictions here, and I leave it to you to draw your own conclusions.

                <h2>Analogy between Cryptos and Stocks</h2>
                <p>
                    We can say that the stock market is a well-established and regulated financial system,
                    while the cryptocurrency market is relatively new and still evolving.
                    But the real problem is that most people don’t think of crypto as an investment—
                    as something very similar to stocks.
                    They think stocks represent factories, goods, buildings, people, and jobs,
                    while crypto is just a few bytes on a computer and a hash.
                    Below, I try to bust this myth and show you that crypto has many commonalities with stocks.
                </p>

                                The same applies to crypto, i.e. Bitcoin (BTC) market cap is $1.6T.
                                And the same applies to the crypto market as a whole, i.e. the total crypto market cap is $2.7T.

                                In crypto, this translates to Limited Supply and Circulated Supply.
                                For example, there are only 21 million BTC, and 19 million (out of those) are already mined.

                                This makes market cap meaningful, and owning a certain number of tokens gives you ownership 
                                    of a proportional share of the total outstanding supply of that cryptocurrency.

                                Imagine BTC is like SPY. When it goes down 2%, many other cryptocurrencies go down 20%.

                                We used to see majority of stock prices between $10 and $100, and this is not a coincidence.
                                There is a standard (aka unsaid rule) and the number of shares is chosed so to follow this as a best practice,
                                    and this has certain use cases. For example, if a stock prices is below $3 it is considered a declining company, 
                                    and you need to sign a waiver to buy it, and you can't even buy such stocks for you 401k.

                                Cryptocurrencies also have a target in mind, and it seems like they choose the number of tokens such that 
                                    its price would be above $1 as an indication of a success. 
                                For example, BlockDAG (BDAG) is something like $.0002 now and the total supply is chosen 
                                    such that it would be $1 by the time when the market cap would reach $150B similar to XRP.

                                This brings certain convenience to the investors, and if you see a cryptocurrency with a price above $1,
                                    then it is likely a well established company with a good adoption 
                                    (just don't use it as a rule, only as a first impression).

                                With stocks, when i.e. CEO of a company buys or sells shares, a form 4 is filed to SEC, so that everyone can see it eventually on SEC web site.
                                With crypto, all transactions are recorded on a blockchain and everyone sees them, and you can see those insider trades from the blockchain explorer.
                                For example, the very first wallet with Bitcoin likely belongs to its creator, and even not having a name on a wallet there are services that actually put efforts into tracking those big wallets.
                                In 2025, Mantra (OM) executives moved 12 million OM tokens from their wallets to exchanges, which alerted the community within minutes, and OM price plunged 91% in 24 hours.

                                In the traditional world of money, we think of a stock as a portion of a business.
                                When you own shares of a company like Facebook (FB), you own a fraction of that company.
                                Upon closer look, when you own a token, you also own a portion of a business or network.

                                For example, if you bought Monero (XMR) tokens, remember that
                                there was $20 million raised during its ICO to launch the project—
                                and behind that are computers, people, jobs, and an entire operational network.
                                By holding tokens, you own a fraction of that future.

                                There is also ICO (Initial Coin Offering).
                                When a company starts a new project, it can raise money by selling tokens to investors.
                                For example, in 2017, the company Block.one raised $4 billion in an ICO for its EOS project.

                                Looking at Solana (SOL), SOL has ongoing inflation to reward validators.
                                Initial total supply was 500 million SOL. 
                                Inflation starts at ~8% annual inflation rate and decreases by 15% each year until it reaches 1.5% annual inflation.
                                As of right now the circulating supply: ~440–450 million SOL.
                                Total supply: ~560–570 million SOL (grows slowly due to inflation).

                                In the traditional world of money, we think of a central bank as an authority that can print money.
                                In the crypto world, the contract is such an authority that can create new tokens, while the algorithm is well known in advance and visible to everyone.
                                For example, Ethereum (ETH) has a monetary policy that dictates new token creation for validators, while a portion of transaction fees (the base fee) paid by users is burned.
                                In many cases, more ETH is burned than created—making ETH potentially deflationary.

                                The FED sets the interest rate for the US dollar, and it impacts everything—including stock prices.
                                In crypto, the interest rate is set by the market and it is called APR% (Annual Percentage Rate).
                                For example, if you stake your ETH, you can earn 5% APR% on it.
                                If you stake your SOL, you can earn 6% APR% on it.
