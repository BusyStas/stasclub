                <h2>The Era of Democratized Stock Trading (1980 - 2000)</h2>
                <p>
                    This particular period is a spectacular illustration of what happens when stock trading goes mainstream.
                     Stocks surged for two decades largely because owning stocks became the norm, 
                     and trading became accessible to everyone—not just brokers. 
                     Investing transitioned from a niche activity among elite traders 
                        to a common strategy for everyday households.
                </p>
                <p>
                    This period represents a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of approximately 13.5% over twenty years.
                </p>
                <img src="{{ url_for('static', filename='images/graph_analogy_spy1980.webp') }}" alt="Stock Market Growth (1980-2000)" style="max-width: 100%; height: auto; margin-top: 20px;">
            
            <p>
                You can see how P/E ratios expanded significantly, especially during the 1990s, 
                indicating that valuation multiples were rising—not just earnings. 
                In simple terms, it wasn’t earnings driving the growth, 
                but the increasing number of participants entering the market and buying stocks. 
                The conclusion is simple: if you enter the market before it goes mainstream, you can more easily multiply your money.

                <h2>The Era of Democratized Crypto Trading (2024 - 2032)</h2>
                <p>
                    Here is why everyone thinks that the same thing is happening with crypto
                        (note, below are the facts that you can easily verify yourself):
                    <ul>
                        <li>The President of the United States has decided to stockpile crypto in the National Reserve.</li>
                        <li>The SEC has withdrawn and ended its lawsuits against many major crypto players.</li>
                        <li>BTC, ETH, and SOL are now available as ETFs and can be purchased through regular brokerage accounts.</li>
                        <li>Crypto is available through Fidelity Investments.</li>
                        <li>Crypto is available in 401(k) plans.</li>
                    </ul>
                </p>
                <p>
                    It’s typical for early adopters to be rewarded generously, as long as you recognize the potential in all of it.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I'm not making any predictions here, and I leave it to you to draw your own conclusions.

                <h2>Analogy between Cryptos and Stocks</h2>
                <p>
                    We can say that the stock market is a well-established and regulated financial system,
                    while the cryptocurrency market is relatively new and still evolving.
                    But the real problem is that most people don’t think of crypto as an investment—
                    as something very similar to stocks.
                    They think stocks represent factories, goods, buildings, people, and jobs,
                    while crypto is just a few bytes on a computer and a hash.
                    Below, I try to bust this myth and show you that crypto has many commonalities with stocks.
