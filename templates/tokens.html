            <h2>Blockchain Networks</h2>
            <p>
                Level 1 networks  are the foundational blockchains that support the entire ecosystem of cryptocurrencies.
                They provide the infrastructure for transactions, smart contracts, and decentralized applications (dApps).
                These are massive investment instruments, because there are hundreds of applications built on top of each of such network.

                Typically, you should not worry whether they are limited supply or not, 
                    since all networks have sophisticated management procedures.

            <h2>Utility Tokens for Crypto Exchanges </h2>
            <p>
                
                Many crypto exchanges have their own native tokens.
                Regardless of the reasons why they do it, 
                    there are billions of dollars in these tokens, and they are very reliable and stable.
                Exchanges host mobile apps and web sites and they have ability 
                    to create huge demand for their tokens, and all this drives the price up. 
                 
                    Typically, you should not worry whether they are limited supply or not, 
                    since all exchanges worry about their prestige, they do buy back or burning, or something similar.
